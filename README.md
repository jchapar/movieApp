## MovieApp

This movieApp was created by following a tutorial video on Brad Traversys Udemy course "50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML, CSS and JavaScript".

## Future Updates

I will be creating a login page for an individual user to better the users experience. Apart from the log in page, I will be implementing a "add" button as well as a list page that will show what movies a user has saved. I will be looking into local storage to help store and retrieve the users saved movies.
